## Big Blue Button on AWS


Source code repository for generating [Big Blue Button](https://bigbluebutton.org/) aws cloudformation templates
using [cfhighlander](https://github.com/theonestack/cfhighlander) tool.

### TL;DR ###

You will need Route53 Hosted zone to launch BigBlueButton cloudformation
stack using regional-specific template, by clicking on appropriate link below

| Region        |Region name    |   Launch url  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
<%- all_regions.each do |region| -%>
| `<%= region['code'] %>` | <%= region['name']  %> | [![Launch Stack](launch-stack.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=big-blue-button&templateURL=<%= region['launch_url'] %>)  |
<%- end -%>

## Intro

This component was initially developed for needs of [AWS Tools And Programming](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-AWS-Programming-and-Tools-Meetup/) meetup

different educational and enterprise settings. By no means is this final version of the component,
and pull requests and feature requests are welcome.

## Prerequisites

- *Valid* Route53 Hosted Zone within AWS Account (e.g. example.com)
